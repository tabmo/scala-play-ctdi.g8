# Scala Play G8 Template - Compile time DI

Inspired from https://github.com/guardian/scala-play.g8

This template provides a project setup for: 
 - A compilable and runnable compile time DI Play project
 - Code formatting with Scalariform
 - A working logback.xml file integrated with the application.

To use, ensure you have SBT 0.13.13 or higher, or G8

Then:

```
sbt new studiodev/scala-play-ctdi.g8
```

You will be asked to fill out some properties required for correctly building your project.

Once done, move to your new project and it should compile and run. Now you can begin customising for your specific projects needs and get started!
